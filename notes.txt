Suggested improvements for Carbontrade API (with their concerns) 

1. NO LOGIN PROTECTION

Concern
The system is currently set up to let anyone in without checking who they are. The "security guard" is essentially asleep.

Consequence
A stranger could access private user profiles or data without needing a password.

Mitigation
Turn on "Authentication" rules so that only people who are logged in can see private pages.

--------------------------------------------------

2. UNPROTECTED PASSWORDS

Concern
Passwords are saved in the database exactly as the user types them, like writing them in a notebook.

Consequence
If a hacker gets into the database, they can read everyone's password instantly.

Mitigation
Use "Hashing" to scramble passwords into unreadable code before saving them.

--------------------------------------------------

3. PUBLIC USER LIST

Concern
There is a web link that displays a list of every single user, their email, and their points balance.

Consequence
Scammers could easily get this list and send fake emails (phishing) to your users.

Mitigation
Delete this link or make sure only the Head Administrator can access it.

--------------------------------------------------

4. LOADING LARGE FILES

Concern
When a user uploads a file, the server tries to open the whole thing at once in its memory (RAM).

Consequence
If the file is too big, the server will run out of memory and crash, shutting down the website for everyone.

Mitigation
Switch to "Stream Processing," which reads the file one line at a time instead of all at once.

--------------------------------------------------

5. HEAVY MATH FREEZING THE APP

Concern
Complicated math (AI analysis) runs right when the user clicks the button, forcing them to wait.

Consequence
The website will look like it has frozen or broken while it does the math, and might time out.

Mitigation
Move the heavy math to a "Background Job" so the user sees a "Processing..." message instead of a frozen screen.

--------------------------------------------------

6. DATA DISAPPEARING ON RESTART

Concern
User accounts are currently being saved in temporary memory (RAM) instead of the permanent database.

Consequence
Every time you restart or update the server, all user accounts across the entire system will be deleted.

Mitigation
Connect the code to the "Database" properly so data is saved to the hard drive.

--------------------------------------------------

7. READING USER PROGRAMS

Concern
The app automatically looks at what other programs (processes) are running on the user's computer.

Consequence
This looks like spyware behavior. Users might get scared that you are tracking what they do on their computer.

Mitigation
Ask the user for permission first ("Opt-In") and explain clearly why you need to check their open programs.
